#' @title Turtle Graphics in R
#'
#' @description
#' Learn computer programming while having a jolly time
#'
#' @details
#' Move the Turtle with commands that are relative
#' to its own position, e.g. "move forward 100 pixels" or
#' "turn right 30 degrees". From these building blocks you can build
#' more complex shapes like circles, fractals, etc.
#' Combined with R control flow, functions, and recursion,
#' the idea of Turtle graphics allows students to get familiar with
#' computer programming in a very accessible and pleasant way.
